## __Staff Attrition__ ##

## _Description_ ##

Staff attrition refers to the loss of employees through a natural process, such as retirement, resignation, elimination of a position, personal health, or other similar reasons. 
A major problem in high employee attrition is its cost to an organization. Job postings, hiring processes, paperwork and new hire training are some of the common expenses of losing employees and replacing them. 
Another problem posed by attrition is that it may lead to loss of customers as customers often prefer to interact with familiar people. 
Additionally, Errors and issues are more likely if you constantly have new workers.
Given the various drawbacks of attrition on a company, it is important to understand factors that contribute to employees leaving a company so that the company can put measures in place to mitigate this.
